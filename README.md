easy-touch-raspberry-pi
=======================

EasyTouch controller implemented on a Raspberry Pi.

This project came from a desire to teach my kids something about programming. I have wanted to work with a Raspberry Pi for some time now, and this seems like a good project.

I have also bought a LinkSprite RS485/GPIO Shield for Raspberry Pi which will be the interface to the Pentair Easy-Touch controller.

I have a wireless Easy-Touch system, but it got some corrosion on the Menu button (the most important one) and stopped responding to any keypress. I called Pentair and they do not service the unit. They suggested I purchase a new one which runs about $500 for the controller and $125 for the receiver.

I figured with $40 for the Raspberry Pi + $12 for the RS-485 controller + a book Getting Started with Raspberry Pi (Make Magazine publisher) I would be out ahead.

Here's a [close up](images/pi-close.jpg) with the RS-485 board plugged in, and a [pull back](images/pi-all.jpg) of the local development environment on my kitchen counter.
